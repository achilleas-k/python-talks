Notes:

## Concepts

- Types, names, variables, objects.
    - Object identity and equality.
    - Mutability
    - Immutable types
    - Immutable containers which contain mutable objects.
- Namespaces.
    - Local scopes, global and nonlocal keywords.
- Classes.
    - Static methods, class methods.  Constructor, magic methods.

## Part 0

Why Python?

---

### Loved and wanted

- Highest *Wanted* language for 3 years in a row: It's the language most people want to learn (who don't know it already).
- 2nd highest *Loved* language.

### *Batteries included*

A rich standard library means users can get started on projects without needing to download separate packages and rely on external dependencies.

---

### Computational science

- General scientific computing: Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Jupyter, Pandas
- Machine learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Workflows and distributed processing: SnakeMake, Dask.

## Part 1

Some basics

### 1.1 Definitions

**Objects**

Notes:
Let's talk about **objects**.  All data in Python is represented by **objects**.  Every object has an **identity**, a **type**, and a **value**.  **Objects** are (often) identified by a symbolic **name**.

---

#### Objects

```python
>>> greeting = "Hello"
```

- Identity: `id(hello)`
  - Equivalent to the memory address (in CPython)
- Type: `type(hello)`
  - `str` (string)
- Value: `10`
  - `print(greeting)`: string representation of a value

Notes:
Let's talk about **objects**.  All data in Python is represented by **objects**.  Every object has an **identity**, a **type**, and a **value**.  **Objects** are (often) identified by a symbolic **name**.

Note that both `id()` and `type()` are built-in introspection functions, but it's generally not recommended to use them in scripts and programs.

---

#### `id()`entity is important

- The `is` keyword compares object identity.
- `==` compares object value.

Notes:
Identity of objects is important and this will become clear later.

For now, keep in mind that `is` compares object identity, so it will return true when comparing two names that refer to the same object.

The double equality compares object values: It will return true when comparing two names that refer to objects with the same value.

---

#### `id()`entity is important

```python
>>> p = [1, 2, 3, 5]
>>> q = p
>>> r = [1, 2, 3, 5]
>>> p == q
True
>>> p == r
True
>>> r == q
True
>>> p is q
True
>>> p is r
False
>>> r is q
False
>>>
```

Notes:
A quick demonstration of why this matters:
- We assign a list of three integers to p
- We assign p to q
- and we assign the same list of three integers to r

And then we see that although all three lists are equal in **value**, only p and q refer to the same object, they have the same identity.

---

#### `id()`entity is important

```python
>>> p = [1, 2, 3, 5]
>>> q = p
>>> r = [1, 2, 3, 5]
>>> p.append(7)
>>> p
[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
>>> q
[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
>>> r
[1, 2, 3, 5]
```

Notes:
And this can have implications for how a program behaves.  It's also a common gotcha for new Python users.

Appending a value to p modifies the underlying object, which means that q also points to the 4-value list but of course r remains intact.

It's easy to follow object identity when looking at examples like this, so this might not seem interesting, but we'll see how this can show up in unexpected places in a bit.

Note here that, in the Python interpreter, we can just type the name of a variable and it will output the value.  This is true of any expression.

---

> Assignments do not copy data â€” they just bind names to objects.

### 1.2 (Im)mutability

Immutable types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`

Mutable types: `list`, `dict`

Notes:
Objects in Python can be mutable or immutable.  This is a (non exhaustive, of course) list of types that are immutable and mutable.

---

#### Immutable objects

```python
>>> greeting = "Hallo"
>>> greeting[1]
a
>>> greeting[1] = "e"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

---

```python
greeting = "Hallo"
greeting = "Hello"
```

Notes:
Here, we're not changing the string, we're just binding (assigning) a new value (a different object) to the name `greeting`.  `greeting` refers to a different object now.

---

```python
>>> greeting = "Hallo"
>>> id(greeting)
4340894704
>>> greeting = "Hello"
>>> id(greeting)
4340894960
```

Notes:
"Hallo" and "Hello" are the values of two different objects (different IDs).  The name `greeting` can be freely bound to either.

---

```python
>>> x = "the number 10"
>>> x = 10
```

Notes:
In fact, a name can be freely bound to anything at any time.  It can be bound to values of different types in the same program.

This will not surprise anyone who's worked with a *dynamically typed* language before.

---

```python
>>> xstr = "The number 10"
>>> xint = 10
>>> xstr + xint
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

Notes:
In Python, **names** can have *dynamic types*, but operations (and methods) can have loose or strict requirements for the types to which they apply.

---

#### Mutable objects

```python
>>> p = [1, 2, 3, 5]
>>> q = p
>>> r = [1, 2, 3, 5]
>>> p += [7]
>>> p
[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
>>> q
[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
>>> r
[1, 2, 3, 5]
```

- `+=` is defined to append two lists and change the LHS **in place**.

Notes:
Back to our previous example, we see how this is different for mutable objects.

---

### 1.3 Collections and iteration

---

#### Built-ins

`dict`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`

---

#### Built-ins: dictionaries

```python
>>> colours = {
...   "red": "ff0000",
...   "blue": "0000ff",
...   "green": "00ff00",
...   "darkgray": "606060"
... }
>>> colours["red"]
'ff0000'
```

- Keys can be any immutable object
- Values can be any object
