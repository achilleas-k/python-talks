# Intermediate Python Features

Presentation slides and code samples for the 5th *Super Python Talk for Life Sciences*.

**Date:** 19 April, 2017

### Slides

The *Jupyter Notebook* in the root of the repository, [presentation.ipynb][presnb], contains the main content of this talk.
You can run through it as a notebook, but it was made to be presented as a slideshow using [RISE][RISE].

A second notebook, [presentation-changes.ipynb][presnbmod], is the presentation notebook but with changes made during the talk, based on questions from audience members.
